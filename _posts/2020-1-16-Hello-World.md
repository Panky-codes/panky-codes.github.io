I have always wanted to blog about what I know. I truly believe in the power and the process of writing. I am sure putting down your thoughts can give you new perspective that was not obvious before.

One thing that stopped me from starting a blog was my notion that you need to know web development for it. And now with github pages and amazing jekyll themes available online, stakes have never been lower to start your own blog.

And finally, all I wanted to say with this post is:
```cpp
#include<iostream>
int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello World! \n"; 
  return 0;
}
```
