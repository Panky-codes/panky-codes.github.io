title: "Adding MSI(x) interrupt support to SerenityOS"
tags: os serenityos
---
Traditional PCI devices use a shared interrupt line to signal the CPU
when they need attention. This can lead to performance issues as all the
devices that are connected to the interrupt line need to invoke their
interrupt handler. Message Signalled Interrupts (MSI) was developed to 
address these problems by providing a more efficient and scalable way
of handling interrupts.

MSI were introduced as a part of PCI 2.2, and it works by allowing the
device to send an interrupt message directly to the CPU through the PCI
bus. When the CPU receives the message, it knows exactly which device
generated the interrupt and can handle it accordingly. This reduces
interrupt latency and helps to avoid conflicts between devices that share the same interrupt line.

The following image shows how E1000NetworkAdapter and NVMe device are
sharing the same interrupt line (10) when using the traditional pin-based
interrupts:

MSI can solve this problem by not sharing the same interrupt line.
I decided add support for MSI and MSIx interrupt mechanism as SerenityOS
was lacking those features.

In pin-based interrupt mechanism, the driver reads the interrupt line
field in the PCI header and uses that to program the interrupt handler.
For MSI based interrupts, the driver has to program the device with an
IRQ number that it wants the device to trigger when an interrupt occurs.
As serenity always used pin-based interrupts, new APIs were introduced to
make MSI(x) work.

Check out MSIx PR before seeing this PR as I added MSIx support first.

#### Additional resources:
Please check out the [osdev](https://wiki.osdev.org/PCI#Message_Signaled_Interrupts)
article and the [intel software manual](https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/671200)
chapter 11 for more information. Even though they were good documentation, I missed
some information when I was implementing this feature. I also used Linux
source code and [Haiku OS](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ahaiku%2Fhaiku%20msi&type=code)
source code to reverse engineer how this feature is implemented.

Happy Hacking!
