title: "Impact of Indirection Unit on Write Amplification in SSDs"
tags: kernel nvme flash

**Write Amplification**: Write Amplification (WA) happens in SSD when the actual
amount of written physical data is more than the amount of logical data 
that is written by the host.

WAF is the mathematical representation of this phenomenon, describing
the ratio of **physical writes to logical writes.** Let us say the host
wrote 4KB, and the SSD has to write 16KB to accommodate that operation;
then the WAF will be **4**. WAF has a direct impact on the **lifetime of the SSDs**
as more WAF leads to more writes to the underlying media.

WAF on the device can be calculated as follows:
```
# io_len: size of the IO from the host
# io_extra: extra IO incurred by the SSD for a given io_len

WAF = (io_len + io_extra) / io_len
```

End-End WAF is a culmination of different WAFs<sup>1</sup>:
```
WAFTotal = WAF_App * WAF_Device
# Splitting WAF_Device further:
WAFTotal = WAF_App * WAF_SSD * WAF_IU
```

WAF contribution happens because of different factors. We will look
into the impact of the Indirection unit(`WAF_IU`) on WAF as part of this article.

## Indirection Unit:

SSDs maintain a Logical to Physical mapping(L2P) table to map a **logical
block** to an underlying **physical** NAND block in its RAM(device RAM and not host RAM).
Logically contiguous blocks do not translate to physical contiguous blocks. This is similar
to how virtual memory works in an Operating system.

If the mapping granularity is 4KB, then a 4KB logical block
corresponds to a 4KB physical block. Whenever a block is written to the
device, a new mapping is created in RAM, and it is used again to find the
corresponding physical block when a read happens.

Having a mapping table will incur some RAM costs for the device. Assuming
a 1:1 L2P with 4KB Logical block size will require at least 256MB of
RAM for an SSD of size 256GB.

```
4KB LBA size in 256 GB SSD = 64M entries (256GB / 4KB)
Each entry could be 32 bits.
64M * 4 bytes = 256 MB
```

The amount of RAM is directly proportional to the size of the SSD.
Extrapolating the same math for 64TB SSD will result in having a
whooping **64GB of RAM** in the device to hold the mapping table.

High-capacity SSDs have already started to appear in the market<sup>3</sup>,
and device vendors need to use new techniques to keep the RAM under
control for mapping table to reduce cost, etc. 

One technique that device vendors actively use to reduce RAM
footprint is to increase the mapping ratio or the **Indirection Unit**. Instead of having 1:1
mapping, device could have n:1 L2P mapping, where n > 1. RAM footprint
is inversely proportional to `n` i.e., multiple logical blocks could
have 1 physical mapping as follows:

Even though increasing the logical block size above 4KB is an option,
backward compatibility with the host will not make the transition
easy<sup>4</sup>. Solidigm's high-capacity drive has an Indirection Unit
of 16k for an SSD with 61.44TB capacity<sup>3</sup>.

The following section discusses the impact of increasing Indirection
Unit(IU) on WAF.

## Indirection Unit impact on WAF:
As increasing the IU is inevitable for high-capacity SSDs, evaluating its
effects on WAF is essential. As multiple LBAs map to a single
physical block, IO writes that are smaller than IU will incur a
Read-Modify-Write(RMW) that leads to WAF. RMW has to read the old data,
merge the new data, and write it back to the media.

| *Read-Modify-Write operation<sup>2</sup>* |

Optimal write should **align and be a multiple of IUs**.
RMW negatively impacts the performance and lifetime of the SSD due to extra
writes incurred.

## Quantifying IU WAF:
`WAF_IU` can be easily quantified by monitoring the IO write patterns coming
from the host.

On a 16k IU drive, io spanning from offset 12k to 32k (`io_len` of 20k)
will incur an `extra_io` of `12k` due to RMW as explained before. The
resulting `WAF_IU` is **1.6**. ASCII art explaining the workload:

```
0        4        8       12       16       20       24       28       32
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|..  LBA space
                           <-------------------------------------------->    io_len
<-#######################->                                                  extra_io
<----------------------------------------------------------------------->    total_io
```

`WAF_IU` can be calculated as follows(code gist [here](https://github.com/Panky-codes/nvme-waf-rs/blob/e1eee2e396dbbf71561ff1f6de62c68cb0576624/src/lib.rs#L12)):

```
# io_offset: IO offset from the host
# io_len: size of the IO from the host
# IU: Indirection Unit

total_io = (round_up((io_offset + io_len), IU) - round_down((io_offset), IU))

WAF = total_io / io_len
```

One interesting observation that the above formula indicates that the
**extra IO** due to IU is caused due to the **unalignment** in the **either ends** 
of **an IO**.

| *Worst case WAF_IU for different IO length* |

The plot above shows the **worst case WAF_IU** for different IO length
on a **16k IU device.** If the **IO size** from the host much
**greater** than the **IU**, then the impact on WAF due to IU drastically
**reduces**. The **biggest impact** on WAF due to IU happens when
the **IO size** is **smaller** than the **IU** of the device.

## Takeaways:
- Indirection units will increase to **reduce cost** for high-capacity SSDs.
- The indirection unit of the device has an impact on **total WAF**.
- Impact of Indirection Unit on WAF is **highest** when **IO size is smaller**
  than the Indirection unit and **lowest** when the **IO size is higher** than
  the Indirection unit.
- The host can **avoid** the WAF due to IU by **aligning** and sending **IO writes**
  that are a **multiple of IU** to the device.
